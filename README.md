## Project Structure

The project structure follows a modular approach to maintain code organization and scalability:

- `src/components`: Contains reusable components used across the application.
- `src/pages`: Houses different pages/views of the application.
- `src/assets`: Stores static assets such as images and SCSS stylesheets.
- `src/data`: Holds sample data used for populating the application with classes, instructors, and other relevant information.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a component-based architecture and efficient DOM manipulation.
- JSX: A syntax extension for JavaScript that allows embedding HTML-like code within JavaScript files, enabling seamless integration of React components.
- React Router: A routing library for React that enables navigation and routing between different views or pages in a single-page application.
- useState and useEffect: React hooks used for managing component state and performing side effects, respectively.
- SCSS: A CSS preprocessor that enhances the styling capabilities of CSS by introducing variables, mixins, and nesting.
